# notes
Here are my personal notes about things that i'm reading/learning about.
Learning in Public is often a motivational booster, however these notes are meant for personal use. If anyone finds them useful I'd recommend reading them in Obsidian, with the Prism pluging, and color the headers as I make frequent use of them.
